# STM32
This is a collection of STM32CubeIDE projects for the STM32F407VET6 board. Each project uses some of the following peripherals:

* ILI9241 - 2.8" TFT touch-screen LCD (display interfaced via FSMC, touch-screen interfaced via SPI).
* MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope (interfaced via I2C).

Every project also outputs telemetry via UART.
